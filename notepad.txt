EDUSTREAM’
Introduction EDUSTREAMs, a technological ecosystem which mainly belongs to the educational institutions, is dominated by the heavenly position of the Administrator. It is a crucial post that involves taking full care of the system from setting it up, maintaining it and updates. It is the duty of the administrators to develop and maintain user accounts, authenticate access, and integrate EDUSTREAM with other e-learning tools to provide a much more interactive learning environment. Their tasks go beyond technical managing and provide users with support and training that are empowering educators and students to fully utilize the platform's capabilities. Furthermore, the administrators safeguard the reliability and safety of the data, hence creating a healthy learning environment. In both designing and utilizing, they put the needs of their organizations first, incorporating new features and updates to make the learning environment interactive and technology driven. As administrators implement their policies, there is a fostering of an interactive intellectual environment that enhances the quality of learning, leading to a connection between learners, teachers, and technology.
Functions 1. User Management: Authorities oversee registering and managing user accounts. Specifically, there is the allocation of user roles, permissions, and the ability of each user to have appropriate access levels.
2. Admin Login: They keep strong admin login mechanisms so that only those authorized persons can get access to the authorized parts of the platform.
3. Report Generation: The administrators use their systems to create various reports that provide useful information about usage patterns, performance, and other important data which are critical for coming up with the best solutions and strategies.
04. Feedback: They gather and process feedback from the users to advance the platform. In this
regard, paying attention to not only students' but also teachers' concerns and challenges is
critical, and decisions are made to improve the situation.
5. Content Management: The task involves managing and organizing the material including the
upload, the updating, and the storage of the educational material. This is done so that the

• RAM(Random access memory): for the seamless performance of this application we are
in need of a server with a minimum of 4GB ram. RAM is the core component that
enables the system to boot the program as well as manage background tasks at the same
time like internet browser, system services and other background stuffs that are running
in the system.
• Processor (CPU): The system will reach its best performance when the server is having
atleast the dual core processor or more. Instruction is followed to process and data is
handled through processing and is usually called the brain of the system. Dual core setup
will permit server not only to perform two independent but also simultaneous tasks at
each of its two cores. This is just what is needed to enable smooth functioning in the peak
hours when the maximum users will use our product simultaneously.
• Disk space (HDD/SSD): at least 20gb hard disk drive with 5200RPM (RPM) is needed
for this app and other programs like windows, microsoft office and an antivirus program,
which will be included in the application. This will include user uploaded content as well
application logs and mysql database as well as apache server. A huge disk space is
necessary for the system to work uninterrupted and normal wear and tear like storage
related issues that affect the system further may slowdown the system.
1Software setup:
 XAMPP: It is essential to install the XAMPP which facilitates completely automatic
installation of the Apache web server, the database of MySQL/MariaDB and the interpreter
of PHP. It solves the problem of having perfect for the common integrated development
environment that is well packaged with all components required for web hosting and thus,
the download and deployment of the app. The other alternative is Laragon and it does the
same either but aside from that, it includes many other additional toolkits. Installed version
of XAMPP is 3.3.0.
 MYSQL database: Our program utilizes the MySQL continuous databse management
system to keep and enforce all data. MySQL is a famed database which is praises for its

Hardware setup:
RAM(Random access memory): for smooth operation of this application we require a
server with a minimum of 4GB ram. RAM is vital for the system to load the program and
efficiently handle concurrent processes such as user requests, database cache and other
background tasks that are running like explorer, browser and other system tasks.
Processor (CPU): The application’s optimal performance requires that the server occupies
atleast a dual core processor. Processor executes instructions and process data and is
often called brain of the computer. Dual core setup will help the server to fulfil two
independent simultaneous tasks on two independent cores. This will come to full use in
the peak usage when multiple users are using our product concurrently.
Disk space (HDD/SSD): atleast 20gb hard disk drive with 5200RPM(Rounds per minute) is
required for this app and other programs that that will be included alongside it like
windows, microsoft office, an antivirus program etc. For our application, this will include,
user uploaded content, application logs, mysql database as well as apache server. Ample
disk space is necessary for the system to work smoothly and avoid storage related issues
that can further slowdown the system.

Apache server, MySQL/MariaDB database and PHP. It provides a convenient solution for
setting up local integrated development environment because it bundles itself with
necessary web hosting elements that are crucial for deploying and hosting the app.
Second alternative is Laragon, and it works the same way as well but includes a few
extra toolkits as well. We have XAMPP version 3.3.0 installed.
 MYSQL database: Our application relies on MySQL relational database management
system to store and manage data. MySQL is a well-known database that is known for its
robustness, scalability and performance. It was acquired by Oracle database so if you
want to go towards open-source route, you can check out MariaDB which is designed by
original author of MySQL and it has same data types as well. Any SQL query for MySQL
will run on MariaDB as well. We are running version 10.4.28 MySQL
13 Apache web server: In our application Apache is used as a web server software that
helps in hosting application web pages and processing HTTP requests from client and
replying to them as well. It includes virtual hosts, dynamic content support as well as
robust security measures. It is very well suited for PHP development. We have XAMPP
version running on windows and 8.2.4

Introduction
EduStream presents itself as a blazing torch of digital education reimagined in the sea of
continuous change of digital education with the most brilliance and sophistication. The key part of
the platform is its well-designed database, a corner which became the fuel of platform’s
advantages, efficiently storing educational materials and tracking personal profiles and
subscriptions. This overwhelming reservoir serves as the legitimate basis for the interactive model
of EduStream, which sets the learner-course relationships aggrandized like never before. In this,
one is the king the grants learners the freedom to choose how they can go for the learning
experience catering to their specific likes and wants.. The database, which can easily hold
exhaustive feedback, score distributions as well as interactions with teachers not only sharpens
personalization of the content, but also supercharges recommendation engines thus every students
receive precise direction based on their needs. Additionally, EduStream's smooth login/logout
operations and easy subscription management reflect user-driven design which gives users a
trouble-free continuous access to knowledge. Therefore, EduStream's database turns out to be the
hinge, which enables a radical rather than gradual reformation of the learning journey both for the
teacher and the student.
Functions
1. Profile Management: Learners can always generate and keep updating their personal
profiles, with details like educational advantages, interests, and learning targets, are
included. This feature guarantees that learners' learning experiences are tailored to suit their
specific interests.
2. Subscription Management: Followers have the chance to cancel, upgrade or terminate their
plans voluntarily as per requirement. They can assess various options and select the one
that closely aligns to their current situation.
3. Feedback: Users may make out comments on most parameters of the platform, such as the
quality of material, the efficiency of learning, and the teacher’s interactions. The insight
from the feedback loop improves the platform, helps it sustain in position and enhances the
overall learning experience.
284. Content Access: Learners are going to have the opportunity to obtain a set of educational
information produced by the developers of the platform and stored in the platform's
database. Such elements comprise videos, articles, quizzes, interactive simulations, and
others. These record numerous subjects and topics.
5. Learning Path: Learners can tailor their experiences according to their specific needs,
interests, goals, and preferences to learning modes. They may be able to search for the
material, follow curated learning paths, or make their own learning paths. That would give
students an opportunity to become the owners of their education and to grow faster than
before.

Hardware setup
Hard Drive: Modern computing not only considers vast storage capacities when building the
computer system, but also gives priority to hard drives as the critical device in a computer system.
Mostly, hard drives store data, programs, and operating systems with magnetic technologies in
order to ensure the long-term storage of data. The latest hard drives in the market today, spanning
from basic models to advanced ones, are characterized by vast storage capacities. The basic models
have a few hundred gigabytes while the advanced ones, on the other hand, are of several terabytes.
For average customers, a hard drive at least 1TB is suggested to address the continuous growth in
size of modern applications as well as media and backup files. Certain jobs like video editing,
gaming, or server administration may become data-intensive and a 2 terabytes or more may be
required. Besides SSDs, which are known for their better data transfer speeds and reliability
techniques compared to HDDs, are also common choices. With SSDs being equipped with flash
memory, the access times will be faster and the latency will be lower. This technology not only
boosts the performance level but also engages in the maintenance of the overall system.
Due to digital content and software development trends, scalable storage options, incorporating
hybrid systems that have HDDs for storage and SSDs for performance improvement, in this case,
29are what is appropriate. This allows the storage system to be equipped with the required capacity
in order to handle future demands without necessitating of upgrades.
Monitor: The monitor is a critical entity with which the output angle of a computer's graphics card
is displayed on its screen, enabling users to engage with different software applications, media and
internet. Modern monitors carry a variety of sizes, resolution, and technologies such as LCD
(Liquid Crystal Display), LED (Light emitting Diode), and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode),
all with their specific benefits and that are ideal for different types of users.
For example, for basic purposes as web browsing and office work, an ordinary monitor with 1920
x 1080 resolution (known as full HD IP) is usually enough. These means keep the level of clarity
while sparing you the expense of high-resolution images. But those who deal with intricate
designing like high-end video editing or graphic design should consider opting for the monitors
that have 4K resolution. This high-res display means more detail and more workspace area to
increase both work efficiency and fun.
Additionally, the refresh rate and response time turn to be everything for players and professionals
who work in time-sensitive situations. High refresh rate (measured in Hz) gives smooth motion
clarity on the other hand, low response time (measured in milliseconds) causes less motion blur,
and both of them leads to having the better viewing experiences. OLED technology delivers the
best color rendition and contrast, which explains the popularity of these monitors especially for
those whose work requires accurate field representation and image fidelity.
Software Setup
XAMPP: XAMPP installation is a rather simple and user-friendly task. Just download the version
which is specific to your operating system from the official website and install it using the wizard.

live websites, its main goal is to install a server environment on your personal computer where
you can develop and test your web based applications without needing a live server.
30VSC: Installation of VS Code (VS Code) is also a simple process. Download the installer from the
official site and then run it. The installer walks you through the setup process in such a way as to
enable you to specify the path for the installation and to create shortcuts. Installing VS Code is all
that is needed, immediately granting the developer the use of a versatile and feature-filled IDE
(integrated development environment) that is equally adept with a number of programming
languages and development tasks.
